# build-something-cool

It's time to make something cool for my portfolio! I develop a game that is similar to Suikoden Game battle/Mortal Kombat Game. I use vanilla javascript and my own CSS. This app is SPA (Single Page Website) took me for 3 days to finish it! I use materialize and jQuery just for the name input opening.

Technology Used:
* Express JS
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Materialize CSS
* jQuery

## Battle Ground!
![Alt text](/screenshot/main.png?raw=true "Battle Ground")
## High Score!
![Alt text](/screenshot/end.png?raw=true "High Score")

```
cd server -> npm install, npm start
cd client -> live-server
```

Good luck & Have fun!
